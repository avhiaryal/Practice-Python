# Practice-Python
I have created this repository to document every python example program created during my learning of python programing.

Here you can lots of python programs that you can use as reference to do some practical programming by yourself.
I recommend you to first just use the title of the program and try to make one of your own.
Come back to see the code if you are stuck or want to see the if there is any different way of doing it.
Ping me if you think the code can be written in better way.
These are all the programs i have done when i just started to learn python so code might be pretty messed up.
Only use this as a reference.
